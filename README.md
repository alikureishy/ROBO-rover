## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/916/view) Points

The goal was to have the rover explore at least 40% of the ground truth, with at least 60% fidelity. Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.

## Writeup / README



## Notebook Analysis
#### 1. Run the functions provided in the notebook on test images (first with the test data provided, next on data you have recorded). Add/modify functions to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.
Here is an example of how to include an image in your writeup.

#### 1. Populate the `process_image()` function with the appropriate analysis steps to map pixels identifying navigable terrain, obstacles and rock samples into a worldmap.  Run `process_image()` on your test data using the `moviepy` functions provided to create video output of your result. 
And another!
