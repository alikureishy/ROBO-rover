# Project: Search and Sample Return

## Overview

This is the first project of Udacity's Robotics Nanodegree program. It involves programming a rover to navigate unknown territory (presumably on another planet like Mars) that had a sprinkling of gold rocks.

The primary [goal](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/916/view) was to have the rover explore at least 40% of the ground truth, with at least 60% fidelity, and to locate at least 1 gold rock in the process.

The ultimate goal (still a work-in-progress) is to explore the majority of the ground truth, or at least enough to be able to locate and pick-up all 6 gold rocks in the process, and to then return to the original position where the rover had started out, all within a reasonable amount of time. This requires more advanced algorithms for improving exploration efficiency, seeking out and picking up rocks whenever visible, increasing mapping fidelity, and developing an efficient return strategy.

Here I'll talk about the approach I took for the primary goal above -- what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.

## Implementation

 



## Notebook Analysis
#### 1. Run the functions provided in the notebook on test images (first with the test data provided, next on data you have recorded). Add/modify functions to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.
Here is an example of how to include an image in your writeup.

#### 1. Populate the `process_image()` function with the appropriate analysis steps to map pixels identifying navigable terrain, obstacles and rock samples into a worldmap.  Run `process_image()` on your test data using the `moviepy` functions provided to create video output of your result. 
And another!
